# ChatBridge Case Study

ChatBridge 

Building an AI Chat Platform with Third-Party App Integration 

Case Study: TutorMeAI 

TutorMeAI is a 30-person startup that has quietly become infrastructure for K-12 education — over 
10,000 districts rely on their AI chatbot platform, with more than 200,000 students and teachers using it 
every day. Their competitive edge isn't the chatbot itself. It's configurability: teachers can shape the 
chatbot's behavior, tone, and focus in ways that competing products don't allow. That distinction has 
driven their growth, and competitors are starting to notice and copy it. 

To stay ahead, TutorMeAI needs to expand what the chatbot can do — not just converse, but orchestrate. 
The next step is enabling third-party apps to live inside the chat experience. Students could play an 
educational game, work through a flashcard set, or interact with a physics simulator without ever leaving 
the chat window. Teachers would retain control over which tools are available. The chatbot would remain 
aware of what's happening inside those apps and respond accordingly. 

The hard engineering problem is the boundary between the chat and the third-party app. Third parties 
control their own UI and tool definitions, so the platform must be flexible enough to support apps ranging 
from simple calculators to complex multi-step workflows. That flexibility is exactly what makes this difficult. 
The chat needs to know what tools an app provides, invoke them with the right parameters, render the 
app's UI inside the chat window, and know when the app has finished its work — all without being able to 
predict what any given third-party will build. Consider a game of chess: a student says "let's play," a board 
appears, they ask mid-game "what should I do here?", the chatbot analyzes the current board state and 
responds, and when the game ends the conversation continues naturally. Every part of that lifecycle has 
to work. 

This creates two categories of challenge you'll be working through this week: 

●  Trust and safety: How do you verify that a third-party app is appropriate for children? How do 

you prevent a malicious or broken app from exposing student data or delivering harmful content? 
●  Communication and state: How do you send messages to a third-party app securely, and how 

does the chatbot stay aware of the app's state throughout an interaction? 

Your goal is to build a production-quality AI chat platform with a programmatic interface that lets 
third-party applications register tools, render custom UI, and communicate bidirectionally with the chatbot 
— with safety and security built into the contract from the start, not bolted on after.

MVP + Pre-search Requirements (24 Hours) 

Hard gate. All are required to pass 

•  Pre-search document 
•  At the beginning of your pre-search document, include a 500-word high-level non-technical 

explanation of the key problems you identified in the case study, trade-offs you addressed, ethical 
decisions that were considered, and what you ultimately landed on. Please name the header 
“Case Study Analysis”. We will be looking at these very closely for quality insights, depth of ideas, 
and understanding of the problem. 500 words is not a lot, so make it count. 

•  A 3-5 minute video presenting your technical architecture. 

Core App Features 

You will build all features on top of a forked version of Chatbox. Push your forked repo to GitLab.

Error Recovery 

Graceful handling when apps fail, timeout, or return errors 

User Auth 

User authentication for the chat platform itself 

Third-Party App Integration Architecture 

This is the core engineering challenge. You must build a programmatic interface that allows third-party 
applications to: 

•  Register themselves and their capabilities with the platform 
•  Define tool schemas that the chatbot can discover and invoke 
•  Render their own UI within the chat experience 
•  Receive tool invocations from the chatbot with structured parameters 
•  Signal completion back to the chatbot when their task is done 
•  Maintain their own state independently from the chat 

Required Third-Party Apps 

You must build at least 3 third-party apps that demonstrate different integration patterns. Chess is 
required. Choose at least 2 more that showcase different complexity levels, auth patterns, and interaction 
styles. Auth is required for at least one third-party application.  

Required: Chess 

Aspect

Interactive chess board with legal move validation 

User can start a new game, move pieces, ask for help during the game, and 
receive error messages for invalid moves. 

Chat Integration 

User says "let's play chess" → board appears → user can ask "what should I 
do here?" mid-game → chatbot analyzes board state → game ends → 
chatbot discusses the game 

Example Ideas for Additional Apps 

These are suggestions to inspire your choices. Build whatever demonstrates your platform's flexibility: 

App Idea 

Why It's Interesting 

Spotify Playlist Creator 

OAuth authentication flow, external API 

Weather Dashboard 

External API, no user auth, UI rendering 

Drawing Canvas 

Rich UI, binary data handling 

Testing Scenarios 

We will test: 

1. User asks the chatbot to use a third-party app (tool discovery and invocation)
2. Third-party app UI renders correctly within the chat
3. User interacts with app UI, then returns to chatbot (completion signaling)
4. User asks chatbot about the app's results after completion (context retention)
5. User switches between multiple apps in the same conversation
6. User asks ambiguous question that could map to multiple apps (routing accuracy)
7. Chatbot correctly refuses to invoke apps for unrelated queries

Performance Targets 

Due to the nature of agentic workflows, use your own judgement on what is reasonable. The app must be 
performant, but you decide where that line is drawn. Users will expect reasonable response times and 
visual cues to ensure things are working, so leverage those tactics to ensure the user experience is 
effective. The lack of expected indicators (spinners, text updates on progress, etc) will be frowned upon 
(by your graders and users). 

Authentication & App Types 

Your platform must handle three categories of apps smoothly: 

App Type 

Auth Pattern 

Example 

Internal 

External (Public) 

No auth needed - bundled with 
platform 

API key or none - no user-specific 
auth 

Calculator, unit converter 

Weather, dictionary lookup 

External (Authenticated)  OAuth2 or similar - user must 

Spotify, GitHub, Google Calendar 

authorize 

For authenticated apps, the platform must handle the OAuth flow, store tokens securely, refresh tokens 
automatically, and pass credentials to the app when invoking tools. 

AI Cost Analysis 

Understanding AI costs is critical for production applications. Submit a cost analysis covering: 

Development & Testing Costs 

Track and report your actual spend during development: 

LLM API costs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) 

• 
•  Total tokens consumed (input/output breakdown) 
•  Number of API calls made 
•  Any other AI-related costs (embeddings, hosting, etc.) 

Production Cost Projections 

Estimate monthly costs at different user scales: 

100 Users 

$___/month 

1,000 Users 

10,000 Users 

100,000 Users 

$___/month 

$___/month 

$___/month 

Include assumptions: average tool invocations per user per session, average sessions per user per 
month, token counts per invocation type, cost of maintaining app connections.

Build Strategy 

Priority Order 

1. Basic chat — AI chatbot with conversation history working end-to-end
2. App registration — Define the tool spec contract, build registration API
3. Tool invocation — Chatbot discovers and calls a single app's tools
4. UI embedding — App renders its UI within the chat interface
5. Completion signaling — App tells chatbot when it's done, chatbot resumes
6. Context retention — Chatbot remembers app results in subsequent turns
7. Multiple apps — Register and route between 3+ apps
8. Auth flows — Handle apps that require user authentication
9. Error handling — Timeouts, crashes, invalid tool calls
10. Developer docs — API documentation for third-party developers

Critical Guidance 

•  The plugin interface is the hardest part. Start here after basic chat works. 
•  Build vertically: get one app fully integrated before adding more. 
•  Define your API contract early — it's the foundation everything else builds on. 
•  Test the full lifecycle: invocation → UI render → interaction → completion → follow-up. 
•  Completion signaling is where most teams struggle. Solve it cleanly. 
•  Think like a platform designer, not just a developer. Third parties should find your API intuitive.

Final Note 

A simple chat with one rock-solid third-party integration beats a flashy platform where apps break 
mid-conversation. 

Project completion is required to move onto the next week.
